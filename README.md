Gemini PDF Extraction Tool
This project is a web-based application built with Streamlit (frontend) and Flask (backend) that uses Google's Gemini API to extract specific information from PDF documents, such as customer details, product details, and the total amount. The application is designed to be simple and easy to use, providing a straightforward way to upload PDF files and receive structured data in return.




Features
1)PDF Upload: Users can upload PDF files directly from the web interface.
2)Text Extraction: The backend extracts text from the uploaded PDF using PyPDF2.
3)Content Analysis: The extracted text is processed by the Google Gemini API to extract customer details, product details, and total amounts.
4)Response Display: The extracted information is displayed on the frontend for the user.
